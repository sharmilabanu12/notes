serial communication - 8 bit data is transferred the same time.
serial communication – 8 bit data is transferred one bit at time.



Serial data communucation uses two method:
  =>synchronous : 
                        clock is transmitted with the data
  =>asynchronous :
                          no clock is transmitted, transmitter and receiver  agree  an the clock speed for the data transmission (baudrate)


UART –  universal asynchronous  receiver/transmitter
USART –  universal asynchronous  receiver/transmitter


Duplex: data can be transmitted and received
Simplex: data can be transmitted only or received {one direction only)
half duplex: data can be transmitted in only on way at a time
full duplex: data can be transmitted in both ways at a time


in  asynchronous transmission, each byte( character)  is packed between start and stop bit

=> start bit is always 1 bit the value of the start bit is always 0
=> stop bit  can be 1 or 2 bits, the value of the stop bit is always 1



 transmitting ASCII’A’- 0100  0000
 ->start bit
-> stop bit


baudrate: connection speed expressed in bits per second.
stop bit: the stop bit is used to signal the end of a frame. 
Parity :Parity is a method of detecting errors in transmission.
