1.structure:
type of struct
{
int a;
int b:
}c;
c varname;


2.typedef struct
{
}GPIO type def;
GPIO- typedef varname;


=>#define GPIOA((GPIO type def*)GPIOA-BASE)


used to choose the AHBIENR
       using structure, when we define the address, using structure members the continous register is changed as the address(Z)GPIOA((GPIO type def*)GPIOA-BASE)
