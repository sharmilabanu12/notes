ARM is reduced instruction set computer (RISC) instruction
set architecture (1SA) developed by ARM Holdings

The story of ARM begins in the 1980s
Acorn Computers, a British computer manufacturer

They wanted a processor that could deliver
High performance
Energy EfficientAn architecture specifies how a processor will
behave, for example
what instructions it has and
what the instructions 


ARM Architecture specifies
1.Instruction set
2.Register set
3.Exception model
4.Memory model
5.Debug, Trace and Profiling


Reduced Instruction Set 1.Computer
2.Simple Instructions
3.Simple Addressing Modes
4.Load Store Architecture
Big Endian or (more commonly) Litle Endian
Pipeline length and layou
Number and sizes of caches

Cycle counts for individual instructions
Which optional features are implemented


Based on this ARM Specification, ARM
develops IP Cores which implements the
specification
IP Core = Implementation in VHDL or Verilog of
a block of hardware logic.


Digits detail hardware characteristics of the processor
Arm946 processor:
the '4 indicates a cache and memory protection unit
the '6' a tightly coupled SRAM interface

The build and design of a processor is referred to as
micro architecture
